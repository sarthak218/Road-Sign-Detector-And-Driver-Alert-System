# Road-Sign-Detector-And-Driver-Alert-System

Road traffic has been the major issue that most cities are facing these days. People neglect the importance of traffic signs which could prove deadly. Currently, the maps services assist us about some details of navigation, but it fails to provide essential information such as “U-turns, prohibited roads, speedlimits, speed breakers and diversions etc.”, which are generally present on the signboards. These are of utmost importance for road safety but the drivers often miss out on them. There is urgent need for a mechanism which would be able to detect these signs and alert the drivers. So, an expert system based on Convolutional Neural Network, will detect & recognize the signboards in real time. Traffic Sign Classification is used to detect and classify traffic signs.

The trained CNN's test results reveal that the model is 98.81% accurate at identifying and detecting traffic signs. The experimental finding demonstrates the Cnn model's strong recognition accuracy for detecting and identifying road signs.

This project presents a method for recognizing traffic signs using deep learning. This approach is efficient in identifying and recognizing traffic signs by utilizing image pre-processing, road sign detection, and classifying. Results of the testing show that the accuracy of this method is 98.81%.
